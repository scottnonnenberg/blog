_[I've got a [Gatsby introduction post](/static-site-generation-with-gatsby-js/), as well as [an intermediate-level post](/practical-gatsby-js/) for more specifics. I'd probably call this one an advanced-level post.]_

I just [open-sourced this blog](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog), based on the [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) static site generator. Very meta! You could be reading this on GitHub! I thought I'd walk through some of the more interesting details, and exactly how I use it.

## My Workflow

Okay, so you've taken a look at the project, and you're feeling overwhelmed. I built up to all of this complexity over a couple months!

Let's start by talking about how exactly I write and publish a new post:

1. Posts start on [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/). I have an _Outline_ folder with lots of ideas and an _In Progress_ folder where I work on drafts. I try to write more than I post in a given week, so I'm always getting more and more ahead of schedule. The Google Docs editor makes it really easy to bang out a post without worrying about [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatting. I can also invite others to review a post before it goes live.
2. When it's time to publish, I use [Google Docs Add-on](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607) get the Markdown version of the post.
3. I create the new file for the post using `yarn run make-post -- "Post Title"`. In many cases I'll update the filename and _[frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)_ date to reflect a future publish date.
4. I copy the script-generated Markdown into the new file, then start cleaning it up. The export script inserts blank lines between every bullet item and line of code, so I fix that manually. It can also easily mess up bold/italic formatting, so I'm finding more and more that I use Markdown text-formatting syntax inside Google Docs.
5. Some cleanup tasks can be automated, so I run `yarn run clean-post` to remove smart quotes, absolute links to my own blog (which should be relative to [preserve the SPA](/practical-gatsby-js/#local-links)), and duplicated links (same target as text).
6. Next is a final visual check and edit, via `yarn run develop` and a browser at http://localhost:8000. This has the benefit of hot reload, so I can see any file updates immediately.
7. Final check with `yarn run build-production`, `yarn run serve` and a browser at http://localhost:8000.
8. Now it's time to get the build in good shape. `yarn ready` checks for a successful build, type errors, code formatting, and broken links.
9. With that, I'm ready to commit the changes in [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - one new file under `posts/`
10. With everything in place, I can push to production! Before I post to social media, it's a good idea to verify the post metadata with [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) and [Twitter](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) debugging tools.

The project readme also covers these key commands. But some of the more complex aspects of the project aren't covered there. Let's take a look...

## Testing React components

While I do rely on visual inspection for my post content, I will be notified via a _build_- or _develop_-time error if my _frontmatter_ is malformed. I can't use the same technique to tell if my [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components are in good shape - I either get somewhat cryptic errors during _build_, or I need to navigate through the entire site in _develop_ mode.

I wanted better.

I added [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to the project and added a good set of permutations for each React component in the project. You can start this up with `yarn storybook`.

Take a look at the configuration in `.storybook` to see what was needed to get it to work. You need to replicate what Gatsby is doing. The trickiest bit was the `loader-shim.js` file, necessary to make `gatsby-link` work properly.

### Manual test script

Yep, my automated tests are pretty great, and give me better confidence that the project is in good shape. Especially when making React changes. But I don't (and can't, really) check for everything with my automated tests, so I made myself a manual test script capturing the stuff not included in the easy-to-remember `yarn ready` shorthand.

In [`test/manual.txt`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/test/manual.txt) you'll find imporatnat stuff:
- RSS/Atom validation
- Meta tag validation with the various social services.
- Proper configuration for the host - we want trailing slashes, proper redirects, and caching.
- Checking for broken links, which brings us to...

## Checking for broken links

This is another form of testing, one all-too-often neglected. A broken link can sometimes come from author error, because the URL never existed in the first place. But more often it's due to the shifting sands of the ever-changing internet. But that's not why I started investigating this space. I wanted to ensure that [deep links](/practical-gatsby-js/#anchor-links) pointing within my blog still worked!

Immediately after starting my search I was happy to discover that the Node.js ecosystem had come through once more: [`broken-link-checker`](https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker) is a node module that does exactly what you'd expect. In my [`package.json`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/package.json#L19-L22) I've got four scripts:

```
"check-internal-links": "broken-link-checker http://localhost:8000/ --recursive --ordered --exclude-external --filter-level=3",
"check-external-links": "broken-link-checker http://localhost:8000/ --recursive --ordered --exclude-internal --filter-level=3",
"check-links": "broken-link-checker --ordered --filter-level=3",
"check-deep-links": "babel-node scripts/check_deep_links.js",
```

The first is very quick, since it keeps the checks local. The second takes longer, useful to do only occasionally to find those pesky sites without true _permalinks_. The third is useful for checking both internal and external links for a single URL - like when I'm about to publish a new post.

The fourth is a script I wrote which piggybacks on top of a `broken-link-checker` local-only run. It harvests those links, then ensures that any link ending in '#hash' has a corresponding `id="hash"` in the page. From [`scripts/check_deep_links.ts`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/scripts/check_deep_links.ts):

```javascript
if (contents.indexOf(` id="${id}"`) !== -1) {
  console.log(`${goodPrefix}${chalk.cyan(pathname)} contains '${chalk.blue(id)}'`);
  return true;
}
```

## Features

Some of the key parts of my blog required some creative solutions, code that might not be necessary using more fully-featured blogging tools. :0)

### Tagging

Gatsby's powerful APIs allow for arbitrary file creation, which allows me to create tag pages quite easily. I [query for the proper data](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/gatsbyNode.ts#L71-L104) (in this case, all posts), then [calculate the tag counts](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/src/util/getTagCounts.ts), then [generate the pages](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/gatsbyNode.ts#L132-L170):

```javascript
createPage({
  path: `/tags/${tag}`,
  component: tagPage,
  context: {
    tag,
    withText,
    justLink,
  },
});
```

### Popular posts

My popular posts list is calculated from _frontmatter_ **rank** data. Those ranks used to be taken directly from my analytics, but at the moment I have no analytics. Privacy for the win!

The magic here is all [in the GraphQL query](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/src/pages/popular.tsx#L41-L55):

```
allMarkdownRemark(limit: 20, sort: { fields: [frontmatter___rank], order: ASC }) {
```

### HTMLPreview

In my [last post I mentioned an `HTMLPreview` React component](/practical-gatsby-js/#html-previews) I use, and the `<div>` separator I use to specify what part of the post should be included in the preview. Now we can take a look at the details. The [`<HtmlPreview />` component](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/src/components/HTMLPreview.tsx) does render the pre-fold data, but it doesn't generate it. 

The preview is generated [deep in the GraphQL query](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/gatsbyNode.ts#L215-L228) to reduce our bundle sizes. We want to pass as little data as possible to the pages so our `page-data.json` files aren't inflated unecessarily.

We're defining a new queryable field in the GraphQL here. The tricky part is fetching the GraphQL fields generated by `gatsby-transformer-remark` to get the HTML it generates from our markdown files:

```typescript
htmlPreview: {
  type: 'String',
  resolve: async (source: PostType, args: any, context: any, info: any) => {
    const htmlField = info.schema.getType('MarkdownRemark').getFields()['html'];
    const html = await htmlField.resolve(source, args, context, info);

    const slug = source?.frontmatter?.path;
    if (!slug) {
      throw new Error(`source was missing path: ${JSON.stringify(source)}`);
    }
    return getHTMLPreview(html, slug);
  },
},
```

`getHtmlPreview` is [defined up-file](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/gatsbyNode.ts#L48-L52):

```typescript
function getHTMLPreview(html: string, slug: string): string | undefined {
  const preFold = getPreFoldContent(html);
  const textLink = ` <a href="${slug}">Read more&nbsp;»</a>`;
  return appendToLastTextBlock(preFold, textLink);
}
```

And finally, [`getPreFoldContent()`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/src/util/getPreFoldContent.ts) returns post content above the `<div>` separator, and eliminates any post explainers surrounded with square brackets (like at the top of this post). [`appendToLastTextBlock()`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/src/util/appendToLastTextBlock.ts) is a relatively complicated method which inserts the provided 'Read More' link at the end of the last block with text in it. This is to allow for Markdown-generated `<p></p>` blocks around images or videos.

Both of these methods are also used in RSS/Atom/JSON generation, as well as the `<meta>` tags at the top of every page...

### Meta tags

Playing well in the modern world of social media previews takes some work. [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters#markup), [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/data-type-selector#site-structure-and-authorized-presence) each have different page metadata used to tune the presentation of your content.

[`SEO.tsx`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/src/components/SEO.tsx) generates tags for all three, using data from the target post and from top-level site metadata, returning components used by `react-helmet`. 

```typescript
function SEO({ pageTitle, post, location }: PropsType): ReactElement | null {
  const data: SiteMetadataQueryType = useStaticQuery(
    graphql`
      query {
        site {
          siteMetadata {
            author {
              name
              email
              twitter
              url
              image
              blurb
            }
            blogTitle
            domain
            favicon
            tagLine
          }
        }
      }
    `
  );
  const { siteMetadata } = data.site;

  return (
    <Helmet>
      <title>{`${pageTitle} | ${siteMetadata.blogTitle}`}</title>
      <link rel="shortcut icon" href={siteMetadata.favicon} />
      {generateMetaTags(siteMetadata, post, location)}
    </Helmet>
  );
}
```

As the manual test script says, it's highly useful to test these tags using the official debugging tools provided by your target platforms.

## Go for it!

There's a lot more to explore: [RSS/Atom XML generation](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/gatsbyNode.ts#L294-L350), [JSON generation](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/f2732d9f118f099d0da63edb82185b478061ea81/gatsbyNode.ts#L352-L380), and more. This is your chance to take something that works and tweak it. Make it something that really works for you!
