_[I've got a [Gatsby introduction post](/static-site-generation-with-gatsby-js/), as well as [an intermediate-level post](/practical-gatsby-js/) for more specifics. I'd probably call this one an advanced-level post.]_

I just [open-sourced this blog](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog), based on the [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) static site generator. Very meta! You could be reading this on GitHub! I thought I'd walk through some of the more interesting details, and exactly how I use it.

<div class='fold'></div>

## My Workflow

Okay, so you've taken a look at the project, and you're feeling overwhelmed. I built up to all of this complexity over a couple months!

Let's start by talking about how exactly I write and publish a new post:

1. Posts start on [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/). I have an _Outline_ folder with lots of ideas and an _In Progress_ folder where I work on drafts. I try to write more than I post in a given week, so I'm always getting more and more ahead of schedule. The Google Docs editor makes it really easy to bang out a post without worrying about [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatting. I can also invite others to review a post before it goes live.
2. When it's time to post, I use [this export script](https://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md/blob/master/converttomarkdown.gapps) to email the Markdown version to myself.
3. I create the new file for the post using `npm run make-post -- "Post Title"`. In many cases I'll update the filename and _[frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)_ date to reflect a future publish date.
4. I copy the script-generated Markdown into the new file, then start cleaning it up. The export script inserts blank lines between every bullet item and line of code, so I fix that manually. It can also easily mess up bold/italic formatting, so I'm finding more and more that I use Markdown text-formatting syntax inside Google Docs.
5. Some cleanup tasks can be automated, so I run `npm run clean-post` to remove smart quotes, absolute links to my own blog (which should be relative to [preserve the SPA](/practical-gatsby-js/#local-links)), and duplicated links (same target as text).
6. Next is a final visual check and edit, via `npm run develop` and a browser at http://localhost:8000. This has the benefit of hot reload, so I can see any file updates immediately.
7. If I've added any new tags, I run `npm run generate-tags` to ensure there's a JavaScript file in `pages/tags/` for each.
8. With that, I'm ready to commit the changes in [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - one new post, and an update to the `next` link in the next-to-last post. Maybe a new tag file or two.
9. Final check with `npm run build-production`, `npm run serve` and a browser at http://localhost:8000.
10. With that static file server running, I can check for broken links on the new post: `npm run check-links -- http://localhost:8000/post-title/`.
11. With everything in good shape, I can push the files in `public/` to production! Before I post to social media, it's a good idea to verify the post metadata with [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) and [Twitter](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) debugging tools.

Whew! It's quite a bit, eh? I won't lie - I would absolutely like [a better solution](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/33) for the tags. :0)

The project readme also covers these key commands. But some of the more complex aspects of the project aren't covered there. Let's take a look...

## Tests

While I do rely on visual inspection for my post content, I will be notified via a _build_- or _develop_-time error if my _frontmatter_ is malformed. I can't use the same technique to tell if my [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components are in good shape - I either get somewhat cryptic errors during _build_, or I need to navigate through the entire site in _develop_ mode.

I wanted better.

I added [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) to the project and started testing my React components in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Enzyme is a great tool, and things were going swimmingly. Until I loaded my first React component that loaded Gatsby-specific modules:

```javascript
import { config } from 'config';
import { prefixLink } from 'gatsby-helpers';
```

Both of these are fake modules, provided via custom [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) module resolution. They don't exist in Node.js!

### Fake modules

To get my tests to run, I brought in a new node module I had never used before: [`mock-require`](https://github.com/boblauer/mock-require). For example, I can make a fake `config` module like this, in [`test/setup/fakes/config.js`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/e2b953fbe1bd1e134de42cb71cb432c5f3791982/test/setup/fakes/config.js):

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

import mock from 'mock-require';
import toml from 'toml';

const configPath = path.join(__dirname, '../../../config.toml');
export const config = toml.parse(fs.readFileSync(configPath).toString());

mock('config', {
  config,
});
```

I had to tell [`eslint-plugin-import`](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import) about these fakes too, because it was giving me lint errors for missing dependencies. That's why you see the `export const config` above; to satisfy the [`import/named`](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/named.md) rule. My `import/resolver` setting now [includes two paths](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/dc92cd27f1d63cf4e7f8782c6dc4dc0b44cdba0e/.eslintrc.js#L17-L23):

```javascript
{
  settings: {
    'import/resolver': {
      node: {
        paths: [
          // to enable absolute paths
          __dirname,

          // so it finds fakes
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'test/setup/fakes')
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Loading stylesheets

I ran into another roadblock the first time I tried to load a React component that imported a stylesheet:

```javascript
import 'css/styles.less';
```

Node.js can't load that! Node.js can only load JavaScript and JSON files!

Another new node module to the rescue: [`css-modules-require-hook`](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules-require-hook). It didn't take much to make it load the [Less](http://lesscss.org/) and do nothing with it. I was [back in business](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/3b3c7786702d98266b8aa6106d5592baf7d7851b/test/setup/css.js):

```javascript
import hook from 'css-modules-require-hook';

hook({
  extensions: '.less',
});
```

Again, ESLint needed a little help dealing with these problematic dependencies. In this case, I told `eslint-plugin-import` to [ignore JSON and stylesheets entirely](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/eslint-config-thehelp/blob/313901f55c86fb94cf2a9ca18e29132b761975e5/core.js#L11-L17):

```javascript
{
  settings: {
    'import/ignore': [
      'node_modules',
      '\\.json$',
      '\\.(scss|less|css)$',
    ],
  },
}
```

### Manual test script

Yep, my automated tests are pretty great, and give me better confidence that the project is in good shape. Especially when making React changes. But I don't (and can't, really) check for everything with my automated tests, so I made myself a manual test script capturing the stuff not included in the easy-to-remember `npm test` shorthand.

In [`test/manual.txt`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/a315ddc9bf92ba9051e0b28dde0308bc26bcfbc3/test/manual.txt) you'll find all sorts of stuff. Mention of SPA scroll and link behavior, tricky per-browser stuff. Analytics verifications. RSS/Atom validation, etc. Some easy-to-run scripts too...

## Checking for broken links

This is another form of testing, one all-too-often neglected. A broken link can sometimes come from author error, because the URL never existed in the first place. But more often it's due to the shifting sands of the ever-changing internet. But that's not why I started investigating this space. I wanted to ensure that [deep links](/practical-gatsby-js/#anchor-links) pointing within my blog still worked!

Immediately after starting my search I was happy to discover that the Node.js ecosystem had come through once more: [`broken-link-checker`](https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker) is a node module that does exactly what you'd expect. After a little bit of difficulty trying to use it with Node.js v6 ([now fixed - by me!](https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker/pull/32)), I was in business. In my [`package.json`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/45ca0189f9a86f64c02bb7a1b04bb84573288b07/package.json#L18-L21) I've got four scripts:

```JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "check-internal-links": "broken-link-checker http://localhost:8000/ --recursive --ordered --exclude-external --filter-level=3",
    "check-external-links": "broken-link-checker http://localhost:8000/ --recursive --ordered --exclude-internal --filter-level=3",
    "check-links": "broken-link-checker --ordered --filter-level=3",
    "check-deep-links": "babel-node scripts/check_deep_links.js",
  }
}
```

The first is very quick, since it keeps the checks local. The second takes longer, useful to do only occasionally to find those pesky sites without true _permalinks_. The third is useful for checking both internal and external links for a single URL - like when I'm about to publish a new post.

The fourth is a script I wrote which piggybacks on top of a `broken-link-checker` local-only run. It harvests those links, then ensures that any link ending in '#hash' has a corresponding `id="hash"` in the page. From [`scripts/check_deep_links.js`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/dc92cd27f1d63cf4e7f8782c6dc4dc0b44cdba0e/scripts/check_deep_links.js):

```javascript
if (contents.indexOf(` id="${id}"`) !== -1) {
  console.log(`${goodPrefix}${chalk.cyan(pathname)} contains '${chalk.blue(id)}'`);
  return true;
}
```

## Features

Some of the key parts of my blog required some creative solutions, code that might not be necessary using more fully-featured blogging tools. :0)

### Tagging

Because dynamic routing support in Gatsby is still forthcoming, I do a little bit of code generation to make my tags system work. First, I put all the logic for a single tag page into [one React component](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/dc92cd27f1d63cf4e7f8782c6dc4dc0b44cdba0e/src/TagPage.js), so I could easily refer to it. Then I generated [this simple file](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/12e542df91469d4407a36b9bb86aa3d713934ebd/src/_tagTemplate.js) into `pages/tags` for each tag, with 'TAG' replaced:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

import TagPage from 'src/TagPage';

export default function TagPageHost(props) {
  return <TagPage tag="TAG" {...props} />;
}
```

The meat of this process is in [`scripts/generate_tags.js`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/37b76b10e22e008934e6c6dfc3fd9f5e33da4632/scripts/generate_tags.js) and [`src/util/getTagCounts.js`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/12e542df91469d4407a36b9bb86aa3d713934ebd/src/util/getTagCounts.js).

### Popular posts

My popular posts list is taken directly from my [Piwik](http://piwik.org/) analytics data, an instance I manage myself. I'll cover it more deeply in the future, but for now I'll just say that I like to have full, private access to my data. :0)

In [`scripts/update_rankings.js`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/7b3da5cc07f8fd797582fcc3bae0b70d4d8d4fd4/scripts/update_rankings.js) I pull data from my Piwik instance, then update the `rank` _frontmatter_ value in all posts found in the data:

```javascript
function getNewContents(rank, contents) {
  const existingRank = /^rank: [0-9]+$/m;
  const newRank = /^[^-]*---/; // allows other stuff in file before ---

  if (existingRank.test(contents)) {
    return contents.replace(existingRank, `rank: ${rank}`);
  }

  return contents.replace(newRank, `---\nrank: ${rank}`);
}
```

### HTMLPreview

In my [last post I mentioned an `HTMLPreview` React component](/practical-gatsby-js/#html-previews) I use, and the `<div>` separator I use to specify what part of the post should be included in the preview. Now we can take a look at the details. The key is this method in the component, in [`src/HTMLPreview.js`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/37b76b10e22e008934e6c6dfc3fd9f5e33da4632/src/HTMLPreview.js#L19-L24):

```javascript
getHTMLPreview(post) {
  const html = post.data.body;
  const preFold = getPreFoldContent(html);
  const textLink = ` <a href="${prefixLink(post.path)}">Read more&nbsp;»</a>`;
  return appendToLastTextBlock(preFold, textLink);
}
```

[`getPreFoldContent()`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/12e542df91469d4407a36b9bb86aa3d713934ebd/src/util/getPreFoldContent.js) returns post content above the `<div>` separator, and eliminates any post explainers surrounded with square brackets (like at the top of this post). [`appendToLastTextBlock()`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/dc92cd27f1d63cf4e7f8782c6dc4dc0b44cdba0e/src/util/appendToLastTextBlock.js) is a relatively complicated method which inserts the provided 'Read More' link at the end of the last block with text in it. This is to allow for Markdown-generated `<p></p>` blocks around images or videos.

Both of these methods are also used in RSS/Atom/JSON generation, as well as the `<meta>` tags at the top of every page...

### Meta tags

Playing well in the modern world of social media previews takes some work. [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters#markup), [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/data-type-selector#site-structure-and-authorized-presence) each have different page metadata used to tune the presentation of your content.

[`src/util/generateMetaTags.js`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/b24cc91ce4f7b44145cb2298418c3aaea43efc60/src/util/generateMetaTags.js) generates tags for all three, using data from the target post and from your `config.toml`, returning an array then [used by `html.js`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/dc92cd27f1d63cf4e7f8782c6dc4dc0b44cdba0e/html.js#L21). Because it's an array, React requires the `key` property in the [JSX](https://jsx.github.io/):

```javascript
function create(name, value) {
  return <meta key={name} property={name} content={value} />;
}
```

For URLs generated for a post, I include a lot more data - images, description (built from the post preview), [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/), etc:

```javascript
[
  create('og:image', socialImage),
  create('twitter:image', socialImage),

  create('og:type', 'article'),
  create('og:title', data.title),
  create('og:description', description),
  create('article:published_time', date),

  create('twitter:card', twitterCardType),
  create('twitter:title', data.title),
  create('twitter:description', description),

  <script
    key="ld"
    type="application/ld+json"
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(ld, null, '  ') }}
  />,
]
```

As the manual test script says, it's highly useful to test these tags using the official debugging tools provided by your target platforms.

### Fancy underlines

After encountering some better-looking links in the wild and reading [this great post](https://eager.io/blog/smarter-link-underlines/), I decided to use some [fancy CSS tricks for my links](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/fe11498b5da21343a86613cd70ecdd0820d5616b/css/styles.less#L67-L73). We create a shadow behind the text which is the same color as the background, then add a gradient background for the underline. The shadow around descenders will interrupt the link underline, making the text easier to read. It works pretty well.

Sadly, because I don't have a way to specify link classes in markdown, I have to do something weird to eliminate inappropriate underlines from linked images: literal HTML including a `class` property. From my [Dangerous Cliffs of Node.js post markdown](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/fe11498b5da21343a86613cd70ecdd0820d5616b/pages/posts/2015-02-11-the-dangerous-cliffs-of-node-js.md):

```

I think it's a reasonable tradeoff, but you might not agree. Now you know, and you can decide!

## Go for it!

There's a lot more to explore: [RSS/Atom XML generation](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/a75189fec32f61ec6871d5765f349d8200b9f143/scripts/util/buildFeeds.js), [JSON generation](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/369b65e9544f49d2fa63ef2176ed340d23c76c76/scripts/generate_json.js), [staging config and builds](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/45ca0189f9a86f64c02bb7a1b04bb84573288b07/package.json#L14), [SPA navigation tracking in `gatsby-browser.js`](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/dc92cd27f1d63cf4e7f8782c6dc4dc0b44cdba0e/gatsby-browser.js#L17-L29), and more. This is your chance to take something that works and tweak it. Make it something that really works for you!
