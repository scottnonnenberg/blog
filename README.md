# https://blog.scottnonnenberg.com

A [`gatsby`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)-based blog.

## Key settings

`gatsbyConfig.ts` contains key data you'll want to change first. The location of the blog, author name and details, gatsby plugins, and so on.

`mailchimp.ts` is the next thing you'll want to change, since it's pointing at my mailing list. The simplest thing to do here is delete this file, `EmailSignup.*` and re-add something like it when you're ready.

## Develop

This runs `gatsby`'s hot-reloading development server on `http://localhost:8000`:

```bash
yarn develop
```

To cover more permutations of a given component, [`Storybook`](https://storybook.js.org/) is a great tool. Start it up at `https://localhost:6006` like this:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

## Build

Generate production-ready files to `public/` folder:

```bash
yarn build
```

_Note: this will generate `rss.xml`, `atom.xml`, `all.json` and `recent.json` to the root `public/` directory along with the site._

## Test

Run `eslint` and the unit tests with `yarn test`.

You can use `yarn serve` to serve static files from `public/` at http://localhost:8000 for manual and automated tests. `tests/manual.txt` has some weird tests you might consider doing if you make some larger changes.

Once you have the static server running you can check for broken links:

```bash
yarn check-local-links
yarn check-deep-links
yarn check-links http://localhost:8000/
```

## Helper scripts

```bash
yarn make-post "The name of your post"
```

Creates a new markdown file from the template at `scripts/util/_postTemplate.md`.

```bash
yarn clean-post
yarn clean-post 5
```

By default processes the most recent file. If a number is provided, it will process that many most-recent posts. Removes smart quotes, duplicate links (same text as URL), and all mentions of the blog's `domain` (taken from `gatsbyConfig.ts`) to ensure that links are all of the relative form.

## Contributing

`yarn ready` is the key thing to run to make sure things are in good shape. It checks types, runs tests, builds the site, and even checks for broken links.

But before you get there, you'll need to make some commits. And this project has some restrictions about how those commits need to be structured. This project uses [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to release new versions, automatically updating the version number and [changelog](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) based on commit messages in [standard format](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md). [`ghooks`](https://github.com/gtramontina/ghooks) and [`validate-commit-msg`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/validate-commit-msg) are used to ensure all commit messages match the expected format (see [package.json](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/master/package.json) for the configuration details).

It takes some getting used to, but this configuration is absolutely worthwhile. A changelog is way easier to understand than the chaos of a raw commit stream, especially with `standard-version` providing direct links to bugs, commits and [commit ranges](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0).
