# https://blog.scottnonnenberg.com

A [`gatsby`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)-based blog.

## Key settings

`gatsbyConfig.ts` contains key data you'll want to change first. The location of the blog, author name and details, gatsby plugins, and so on.

`mailchimp.ts` is also excluded from the repository, used by the `<EmailSignup>` React component in displaying its form. It uses five keys:

```javascript
export default {
  account: 'your account name, the first part of your mailchimp links',
  shard: 'the second component of your mailchimp links - like "us12"',
  u: 'the "u" value in your embedded mailchimp form',
  id: 'the "id" value in your embedded mailchimp form',
  fakeField: 'the field for robots in the embedded mailchimp form',
};
```

_Note: if you don't want to connect to a mailchimp mailing list, delete the `<EmailSignup>` component. You put can a file at `/mailchimp.ts` (like `export default {};`) to make things work until you take it out._

## Develop

```bash
yarn develop
```

This runs `gatsby`'s hot-reloading development server on http://localhost:8000.

## Build

Generate production-ready files to `public/` folder:

```bash
yarn build # or yarn build-staging
```

_Note: this will generate `rss.xml`, `atom.xml`, `all.json` and `recent.json` to the root `public/` directory along with the site._

## Test

Run `eslint` and the unit tests with `npm test`.

You can use `yarn serve` to serve static files from `public/` at http://localhost:8000 for manual and automated tests. A manual test script is available at `tests/manual.txt` - it covers the parts of the user experience without automated tests.

Once you have the static server running you can check for broken links:

```bash
yarn check-local-links
yarn check-external-links
yarn check-deep-links
yarn check-links http://localhost:8000/
```

_Note: Due to the meta tags on each page, you'll get broken links on a `check-external-links` run until you've published all pages to production._

## Helper scripts

```bash
yarn make-post "The name of your post"
```

Creates a new markdown file from the template at `scripts/util/_postTemplate.md`.

```bash
yarn clean-post
yarn clean-post 5
```

By default processes the most recent file. If a number is provided, it will process that many most-recent posts. Removes smart quotes, duplicate links (same text as URL), and all mentions of the blog's `domain` (taken from `gatsbyConfig.ts`) to ensure that links are all of the relative form.

## Contributing

This project uses [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) to release new versions, automatically updating the version number and [changelog](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) based on commit messages in [standard format](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md). [`ghooks`](https://github.com/gtramontina/ghooks) and [`validate-commit-msg`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/validate-commit-msg) are used to ensure all commit messages match the expected format (see [package.json](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/blob/master/package.json) for the configuration details).

It takes some getting used to, but this configuration is absolutely worthwhile. A changelog is way easier to understand than the chaos of a raw commit stream, especially with `standard-version` providing direct links to bugs, commits and [commit ranges](https://github.com/scottnonnenberg/blog/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0).
