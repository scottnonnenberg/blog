scripts to run periodically:
  npm run check-internal-links - runs very fast
  npm run check-external-links
    403 (quora) - often indicates false-positive, server doesn't like a robot doing a HEAD request
    405 (amazon) - often indicates false-positive, server doesn't support HEAD

  npm run check-deep-links - to ensure that hash links within site continue to work

html
  overall page is structured properly
  CSS loads in develop and production
  Javascript loads in develop, but only in production of config.noProductionJavascript is not set

meta tags
  Meta tags for articles are well-formed
  Meta tags for front page and other non-articles are well-formed
  Test with structured data validators:
    https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
    https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
    https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/

  validate proper scrolling to hash links - be sure to check back/forward, scroll positions, etc. Messy.
