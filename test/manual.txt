Check for broken links:
  yarn run check-external-links

  It takes a while and is a bit messy. Here are some known weird responses:
    403 (quora) - often indicates false-positive, server doesn't like a robot doing a HEAD request
    405 (amazon) - often indicates false-positive, server doesn't support HEAD

  Note: Due to the meta tags on each page, you'll get broken links on this run until you've published all pages to production.
